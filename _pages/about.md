<strong style="font-weight:900; font-size:1.3em;">About</strong>

Hello! I’m **Jixiang Fan**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, working with [Dr. D. Scott McCrickard](https://people.cs.vt.edu/mccricks/) in the [Center for Human–Computer Interaction (CHCI)](https://hci.icat.vt.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of <u>Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)</u> and <u>Computing Education Research (CER)</u>, where I explore how diary studies and focus group discussions can be used as pedagogical tools to foster empathy, reflection, and collaborative design skills in computing education. I develop frameworks (PCAR Framework) and tools (DiaryQuest, DiaryLib) that integrate qualitative methods with computational analysis, aiming to make HCI concepts more tangible for students. My work has been disseminated across multiple venues, including full paper at the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS), as well as other conferences that connect the HCI and computing education communities.

I earned my M.S. in [Computer Science from Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), and my B.S. degrees in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) and [Economics](https://www.econ.umd.edu/) from the University of Maryland – College Park. At Virginia Tech, I have served as a leading instructor for Professionalism in Computing (CS3604), guiding nearly 200 undergraduates in exploring ethical, social, and professional dimensions of computing. In addition, I have been a Teaching Assistant for twelve semesters across courses ranging from introductory programming (CS1 and CS2) and data structures to advanced Human–Computer Interaction. Beyond the classroom, I actively mentor undergraduate researchers, supporting student-led projects that have resulted in conference papers, posters, and student research competitions. I also hold the Future Professoriate Certificate from the Virginia Tech Graduate School and am a member of the Virginia Tech Academy for Graduate Teaching Assistant Excellence (VT GrATE).

I am expected to graduate in **2026** and am actively seeking **postdoctoral or academic opportunities**. I would be delighted to connect about potential openings, collaborations, or shared research interests. Please feel free to reach out to me at [jfan12@vt.edu](mailto:jfan12@vt.edu).

<!-- Pedagogical Methods & Tools for HCI Education -->
<div style="margin:1rem 0;">
  <div style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.1em; margin-bottom:0.35rem;">
    Pedagogical Methods &amp; Tools for HCI Education
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    This branch of my research develops and evaluates pedagogical frameworks that use diary studies and
    focus group discussions as central methods for teaching human–computer interaction. A key outcome of
    this work is the <strong>PCAR (Plan–Collect–Analyze–Reflect) diary study framework</strong>, introduced and refined through
    classroom implementations and published at SIGCSE TS 2025. PCAR provides a structured process not only
    for <strong>students</strong> to document and analyze their technology use and engage in collaborative reflection, but also for
    <strong>educators</strong> to integrate diary studies into course design and assessment, and for <strong>researchers</strong> to plan,
    manage, and analyze diary-based studies systematically. I also design, build, and assess software tools (e.g., DiaryQuest, DiaryLib)
    that operationalize these methods and make them scalable within HCI curricula.
  </p>

<!-- Supporting Students’ Metacognitive Growth in Design and Computing -->
<div style="margin:1rem 0;">
  <div style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.1em; margin-bottom:0.35rem;">
    Supporting Students’ Metacognitive Growth in Design and Computing
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    This branch of my research examines how students develop metacognitive awareness—how they understand
    and regulate their own learning processes—when engaging in reflective practices. In HCI contexts, I have
    emphasized changes in empathy as a measurable outcome, using instruments such as the Empathy in Design
    Scale to track growth across individual and group learning stages. Looking ahead, I aim to extend this work
    beyond design courses to coding and related computing curricula, using diary study as a framework to
    investigate how students monitor, reflect on, and adapt their approaches to programming. This line of
    research seeks to capture a broader set of cognitive and affective factors that shape students’ ability to
    critically evaluate problems, strategies, and user needs in both design and coding contexts.

<!-- Preparing Students for Real-World Computing Practice -->
<div style="margin:1rem 0;">
  <div style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.1em; margin-bottom:0.35rem;">
    Preparing Students for Real-World Computing Practice
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    This branch of my research connects classroom learning to professional contexts, emphasizing how computing
    students develop the skills needed to succeed in industry. In addition to professional competencies such as
    collaboration, communication, and ethical awareness, I am also interested in how students can be better prepared
    to engage with the technical realities of software development in practice—for example, how large teams divide
    responsibilities across modules, how APIs are designed and interpreted across groups, and how organizational
    structures shape coding practices. Drawing on my own industry experience and ongoing exchanges with computing
    professionals, I am interested in exploring educational practices that integrate both technical and professional
    dimensions, helping students bridge theory and practice as they prepare for the complexities of real-world computing work.

    Other Areas
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    Here are some additional areas I am interested in exploring:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:1.2rem;">
    <li>Games as a medium for HCI education and reflection, particularly how playful contexts can scaffold empathy, collaboration, and critical thinking.</li>
    <li>The integration of artificial intelligence into computing education in ways that are pedagogically meaningful, ethically responsible, and supportive of students’ learning rather than replacing it.</li>
    <li>Emerging modalities in immersive learning environments, such as <strong>VR with olfactory interfaces</strong>, and their potential to expand sensory dimensions of educational experiences.</li>
  </ul>
