<strong style="font-weight:900; font-size:1.3em;">About</strong>

Hello! I’m **Jixiang Fan**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, working with [Dr. D. Scott McCrickard](https://people.cs.vt.edu/mccricks/). My research is grounded in <u>Computing Education Research (CER)</u>, where I examine how qualitative methods such as diary studies and focus group discussions can be used as pedagogical tools to foster empathy, reflection, and collaborative design skills in computing education. Drawing on perspectives from Human–Computer Interaction, I develop instructional frameworks (e.g., the PCAR Framework) and educational tools (e.g., DiaryQuest, DiaryLib) that integrate reflective practice with computational analysis to support students’ learning and sense-making. My work has been disseminated through multiple computing education venues, including a full paper at the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS), as well as related interdisciplinary conferences.

I earned my M.S. in [Computer Science from Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), and my B.S. degrees in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) and [Economics from the University of Maryland – College Park](https://www.econ.umd.edu/). At Virginia Tech, I have served as a leading instructor for Professionalism in Computing (CS3604), guiding nearly 200 undergraduates in exploring ethical, social, and professional dimensions of computing. In addition, I have been a Teaching Assistant for twelve semesters across courses ranging from introductory programming (CS1 and CS2) and data structures to advanced Human–Computer Interaction. Beyond the classroom, I actively mentor undergraduate researchers, supporting student-led projects that have resulted in conference papers, posters, and student research competitions. I also hold the Future Professoriate Certificate from the Virginia Tech Graduate School and am a member of the Virginia Tech Academy for Graduate Teaching Assistant Excellence (VT GrATE).

I am expected to graduate in **2026** and am actively seeking **postdoctoral or academic opportunities**. I would be delighted to connect about potential openings, collaborations, or shared research interests. Please feel free to reach out to me at [jfan12@vt.edu](mailto:jfan12@vt.edu).

<div style="margin:1rem 0;">
  <div style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.1em; margin-bottom:0.35rem;">
    Pedagogical Methods &amp; Tools for Computing Education
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    This line of my research develops and evaluates pedagogical frameworks that integrate diary studies and
    focus group discussions into <strong>computing education</strong>. A central outcome of this work is the
    <strong>PCAR (Plan–Collect–Analyze–Reflect) diary study framework</strong>, introduced and refined through
    classroom implementations and published at SIGCSE TS 2025. PCAR offers a structured process that supports
    <strong>students</strong> in documenting and analyzing their computing-related experiences through reflection and collaborative discussion,
    enables <strong>educators</strong> to systematically incorporate diary-based activities into course design and assessment,
    and assists <strong>researchers</strong> in planning, managing, and analyzing diary-based educational studies. I also design,
    build, and evaluate educational software tools (e.g., DiaryQuest, DiaryLib) that operationalize these methods
    and support their scalable adoption across computing curricula.
  </p>
</div>


<!-- Supporting Students’ Metacognitive Growth in Computing -->
<div style="margin:1rem 0;">
  <div style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.1em; margin-bottom:0.35rem;">
    Supporting Students’ Metacognitive Growth in Computing
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    This line of my research examines how students develop metacognitive awareness—how they understand,
    monitor, and regulate their own learning processes—through structured reflective practices in
    <strong>computing education</strong>. In earlier work situated in design-oriented courses, I examined empathy
    as one observable learning outcome using validated instruments such as the Empathy in Design Scale.
    Building on these findings, I am extending this research to programming and related computing curricula,
    using diary studies as an instructional and analytical framework to investigate how students reflect on,
    evaluate, and adapt their approaches to coding tasks. This work aims to capture a broader set of cognitive
    and affective factors that shape students’ problem-solving, strategy selection, and critical evaluation
    across diverse computing learning contexts.

<!-- Preparing Students for Real-World Computing Practice -->
<div style="margin:1rem 0;">
  <div style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.1em; margin-bottom:0.35rem;">
    Preparing Students for Real-World Computing Practice
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    This branch of my research connects classroom learning to professional contexts, emphasizing how computing
    students develop the skills needed to succeed in industry. In addition to professional competencies such as
    collaboration, communication, and ethical awareness, I am also interested in how students can be better prepared
    to engage with the technical realities of software development in practice—for example, how large teams divide
    responsibilities across modules, how APIs are designed and interpreted across groups, and how organizational
    structures shape coding practices. Drawing on my own industry experience and ongoing exchanges with computing
    professionals, I am interested in exploring educational practices that integrate both technical and professional
    dimensions, helping students bridge theory and practice as they prepare for the complexities of real-world computing work.

    Other Areas
  </div>
  <p style="margin:0.25rem 0;">
    Here are some additional areas I am interested in exploring:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:1.2rem;">
    <li>Games as a medium for Computing education and reflection, particularly how playful contexts can scaffold empathy, collaboration, and critical thinking.</li>
    <li>The integration of artificial intelligence into computing education in ways that are pedagogically meaningful, ethically responsible, and supportive of students’ learning rather than replacing it.</li>
    <li>Emerging modalities in immersive learning environments, such as <strong>VR with olfactory interfaces</strong>, and their potential to expand sensory dimensions of educational experiences.</li>
  </ul>
