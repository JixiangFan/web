<strong style="font-weight:900; font-size:1.3em;">About</strong>

Hello! I’m **Jixiang Fan**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, working with [Dr. D. Scott McCrickard](https://people.cs.vt.edu/mccricks/) in the [Center for Human–Computer Interaction (CHCI)](https://hci.icat.vt.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of <u>Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)</u> and <u>Computing Education Research (CER)</u>, where I explore how diary studies and focus group discussions can be used as pedagogical tools to foster empathy, reflection, and collaborative design skills in computing education. I develop frameworks (PCAR Framework) and tools (DiaryQuest) that integrate qualitative methods with computational analysis, aiming to make HCI concepts more tangible for students. My work has been disseminated across multiple venues, including full paper at the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS), as well as other conferences that connect the HCI and computing education communities.

I earned my M.S. in [Computer Science from Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), and my B.S. degrees in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) and [Economics](https://www.econ.umd.edu/) from the University of Maryland – College Park. At Virginia Tech, I have served as a leading instructor for Professionalism in Computing (CS3604), guiding nearly 200 undergraduates in exploring ethical, social, and professional dimensions of computing. In addition, I have been a Teaching Assistant for twelve semesters across courses ranging from introductory programming (CS1 and CS2) and data structures to advanced Human–Computer Interaction. Beyond the classroom, I actively mentor undergraduate researchers, supporting student-led projects that have resulted in conference papers, posters, and student research competitions. I also hold the Future Professoriate Certificate from the Virginia Tech Graduate School and am a member of the Virginia Tech Academy for Graduate Teaching Assistant Excellence (VT GrATE).

I am expected to graduate in **2026** and am actively seeking **postdoctoral or academic opportunities**. I would be delighted to connect about potential openings, collaborations, or shared research interests. Please feel free to reach out to me at [jfan12@vt.edu](mailto:jfan12@vt.edu).

<p><strong>May 2025:</strong> I successfully passed my preliminary exam and advanced to Ph.D. candidacy in Computer Science at Virginia Tech!</p>

<p><strong>Apr 2025:</strong> Two Late-Breaking Work papers from our lab were accepted at CHI 2025 in Yokohama, Japan. I am the first author of <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706599.3719751">Understanding the Creation of Human-Virtual Entity Bonds through the AR Mobile Game Peridot</a></em>, and contributed as a co-author to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706599.3721215">another LBW paper</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Feb 2025:</strong> I took part in the 56th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS 2025) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I shared my paper <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3641554.3701845">Diary Study as an Educational Tool: An Experience Report from an HCI Course</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Feb 2025:</strong> I was invited to give a talk at the 56th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS 2025) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As part of the Birds of a Feather session on <em><a href="https://sigcse2025.sigcse.org/details/sigcse-ts-2025-affiliated-events/4/Accessibility-and-Disability-in-CS-Education">Accessibility and Disability in CS Education</a></em>, I presented <em>Integrating Disability Considerations into Design Raising Awareness and Building Inclusivity</em>.</p>
